Usage
-----

This script is meant to be paired as a companion of "buildrom". The easiest way to pair it is to just download it right into your home path and set it to run "ON_SUCCESS", like this:

	ON_SUCCESS='. ~/otagen.sh'

That'll let it hold the values expected by the script to let it comprehend your environment.
